<h2>2 Installation Choices? (Pure PHP or Database CMS)</h2><br /><br />

<b>Pure PHP:</b><br />

This option is called TT-PHP and is designed to be a lightweight platform for pure PHP designers. If you setup client sites on a regular basis then you know how tedious the initial setup can be.  You have to create directories, pages, headers, meta, css, and possibly a simple template system.<br /><br />

The only core feature included is the template engine because PHP scripters benefit from separating logic and presentation.  Templating can be an easy solution at the very least for keeping your code indents from traveling half the page.  If you absolutely don't want to use the templating engine, or aren't experienced enough to, you don't have to, simply remove the template_eng.inc from index.php and you're free to code as purely as your heart desires.<br /><br /> 

Install TT-PHP as a solid base and you can begin designing immediately.  This is what allows Treasure Trove to be anything you want it to be, from a tiny-scale site to an ever-expanding collosus of a CMS. When TT-PHP is installed it will automatically delete directories that the CMS install would require.  Deleting them is to remove unnecessary bloat for a pure php site.<br /><br />

Directories that a TT-PHP installation will automatically delete:<br />
/Core/<br />
/Plugin/<br />
/Theme/<br />
/Install/<br /><br />

Features left for TT-PHP:<br />
HTACCESS<br />
PHP indexes<br />
HTML template engine<br />
CSS file<br /><br />

Later, if you need to upgrade to TT-CMS you must replace missing directories from the core package and run the installer again. You will be presented the installer screen but this time choose Database CMS.  All of your files from your pure PHP work will not be touched in any way giving you a safe and seamless upgrade from one installation to another.<br /><br />
 
<b>Database CMS:</b><br />
It's a fast and highly efficient means of empowering web developers.  The installation is highly customizable with an emphasis on adding to the core package what you want instead of trying to strip unnecessary bloat after the fact.  We provide the core, some ready-to-use functions, and a couple of plugins to choose from.  Although it might sound minimialistic the scope of the CMS is indeed grand.  How minimal or powerful the CMS becomes is truly up to you.  The possibilities are infinite.<br /><br />
